# User Defined Functions

## Overview

The Ras-Lights app was written so I could teach my kids to code with TypeScript,
and so I could play along too. To get started, you'll need to:

-   clone the user library template Github Repo into your own repo
-   clone your user library onto your computer and onto the pi
-   add the user library onto your pi

Then, to add your own functions to the Ras-Lights app, you'll need to:

-   create a function template using the Ras-Lights template tab
-   copy the template into your repo and fill in the function with your own special logic in the template
-   import your new module
-   compile (transpile) your code
-   push your code to Github and pull it down to your pi.

If this sounds intimidating, well, it can be at first. But once you've done it
a couple of times, you'll notice that each step becomes more and more familiar,
and (hopefully) the guide below will help get you started.
