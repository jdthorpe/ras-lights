# User Libraries

When using the editor, there is a menu of functions that can be used to compose
a light show. These functions are written in TypeScript and are defined in a
"library". You can create your own functions called "effects" (as in "special
effects") and use them in your own light shows. 

Please **note that** to create your own library, you'll need to be familiar with the
basics of TypeScript and NodeJS. 

The [User Library Setup](../user-library-setup) page will guide you through the
process of creating your own library and tell your Raspberry Pi to load it along
with the default libraries.

The [User Library Workflow](../user-library-workflow) page illustrates the steps
to add a new function to your library.
