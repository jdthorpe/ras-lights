# Ras Lights Docs

This guide is here to get you up and running hosting an interactive LED light
show on your Raspberry Pi without *having* to learn much coding, and maybe
you'll decide to learn a little coding along the way.

## Why do you want this? \[non-coder\]

If you just want to play with a Raspberry Pi, animated light shows are a lot of
fun, and make for a great introduction to using the Raspberry Pi

- This app will help you **get up and running quickly**. A one line install will
get this app onto your Pi, and the admin portal makes configuring you light
strands super simple.

- The web app has a graphical editor that lets you easily compose special
effects to make your very own light shows **with no coding required**!
  
- It has a scheduler so you can set your favorite light shows to run every
morning, animate your team's colors on game days, and turn the lights off at
night to que your kids that it's time for bed.

## Why do you want this? \[coder\]

This app uses typescript to build special effects that run in the browser and on
the Pi.  The docs will show you a couple JS tricks that are often over looked by
new coders in JS / TS, and there's no better way to learn than by doing.  Plus,
animating light shows it probably the funnest way to learn basic concepts like
array manipulation and practical application of algebraic operators like `%` and `^`.

## Why did I build this?

I wrote the Ras-Lights app so I could teach my kids a little about coding --
especially that cool things are often build from simple things that are put
together in interesting ways. But more specifically to get my little buddy to
play in graphical coding environment and to get my older one a little used to
seeing some typescript and relating it to some math concepts from school.

But mostly so I made it to have fun playing with my kids. Maybe you'll have fun
too, maybe you'll use it to practice TypeScript, and maybe you'll use it with
your kids too.
