# User Libraries

When using the editor, there are a menu of functions that can be used to compose
light show.  These functions are defined in a library, and you can create your
own functions called "effects" (as in "special effects") and use them in your
own light shows. 

The [User Library Setup](../user-library-setup) page, will guide you through the
process of creating you're own library and tell your Raspberry Pi to load it
along with the default libraries.

The [User Library Workflow](../user-library-workflow) page illustrates the steps
to add a new function to your library.
