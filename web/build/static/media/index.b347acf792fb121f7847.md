# Ras Lights Docs

The Ras-Lights app was written so I could teach my kids a little about coding --
especially that cool things are often build from simple things that are put
together in interesting ways. But more specifically to get my little buddy to
play in graphical coding environment and to get my older one a little used to
seeing some typescript and relating it to some math concepts from school.

But mostly so I made it to have fun playing with my kids. Maybe you'll have fun
too, maybe you'll use it to practice TypeScript, and maybe you'll use it with
your kids too.

This guide is here to get you up and running hosting an interactive LED light
show on your Raspberry Pi without *having* to learn much coding, and maybe
you'll decide to learn a little coding along the way.
